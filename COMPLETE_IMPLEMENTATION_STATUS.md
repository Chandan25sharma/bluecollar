// Add AddressManager in selectable mode
<AddressManager
  selectable={true}
  onSelectAddress={(addr) => setSelectedAddress(addr)}
/>;

// Update booking submission
const bookingData = {
  serviceId,
  providerId,
  date,
  notes,
  clientAddress: selectedAddress?.address,
  clientLatitude: selectedAddress?.latitude,
  clientLongitude: selectedAddress?.longitude,
};
```

### B. Update Provider Dashboard (High Priority)

**File:** `frontend/app/dashboard/provider/page.tsx`

**Show Client Details in Booking Requests:**

```tsx
// Display client location info
<div className="booking-request">
  <h3>{booking.client.name}</h3>
  <p>📍 {booking.clientAddress}</p>
  <p>📏 {booking.distance} km away</p>
  <button onClick={() => viewOnMap(booking)}>View on Map</button>
</div>
```

- Location picker
- Save coordinates with profile

### D. Enhanced Service Cards (Medium Priority)

**File:** `frontend/app/dashboard/client/page.tsx`

**Show Distance on Cards:**

```tsx
<div className="service-card">
  <h3>{service.title}</h3>
  <p>📏 {service.distance} km away</p>
  <p>⚡ {service.provider.name}</p>
</div>
```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Google Maps API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable these APIs:

5. Restrict the key:
   - **Application restrictions:** HTTP referrers
   - Add: `http://localhost:3000/*` and your production domain
   - **API restrictions:** Select the 3 APIs above

### 2. Configure Environment

Create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4001/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Start Services

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
